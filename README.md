# Time Series Analysis and Clustering Project

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks and dataset files for exploring, analyzing, and modeling time series data, including clustering, forecasting, and classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze time series data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering of series, and forecasting future values. The project also includes classification tasks on time series data. This work demonstrates several data science techniques on time series data using Python.

## Files and Notebooks

- `combined_train_clean.csv`  
  The main dataset used for analysis and modeling. It contains cleaned and combined time series data ready for use.

- `eda.ipynb`  
  Exploratory Data Analysis notebook. This notebook includes data loading, visualization, and initial statistics to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

- `clustering.ipynb`  
  Notebook for clustering time series data. It explores different clustering methods to group similar time series based on features or distance metrics.

- `forecasting.ipynb`  
  Contains time series forecasting models and experiments. The notebook demonstrates different forecasting techniques to predict future values.

- `time_series_classification.ipynb`  
  This notebook applies classification techniques to time series data, including feature extraction and model training for classification tasks.
